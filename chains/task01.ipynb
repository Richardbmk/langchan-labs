       "'The five factors that can help you build a killer business strategy are:\\n\\n1. Needs: Start by identifying and defining the user needs within your business scope. Understand what your users expect from your products or services.\\n\\n2. Value Chain: Create a value chain by identifying the components needed to meet the user needs. This chain will show how different components are related and contribute to fulfilling those needs.\\n\\n3. Map: Turn your value chain into a map by adding an evolution axis. Place components on the map based on their level of evolution, from novel and rare to common and widespread.\\n\\n4. Challenge and refine: Share your map with others in your organization and encourage them to challenge and provide feedback. This will help refine the map and ensure accuracy in representing your business landscape.\\n\\n5. Strategy cycle: Use your map to navigate the strategy cycle, involving observing the environment, orienting around it, deciding on a course of action, and taking action. Iteratively go through this cycle to learn and adapt your strategy based on the evolving landscape of your business.'"
